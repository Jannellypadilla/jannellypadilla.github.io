    <td> Hi! I'm Maggie.  I'm 17 and I'm from Massachusetts. I worked on some of the interactive features of this page as a way to educate people on the importance of this cause and direct people to resources that can help them. I focused on the correlation between income and health, since low income individuals and families, who are often poc, must overcome significant challenges just to achieve basic healthcare, like medication, and often can't afford health insurance. </td>
    
    <td> Hello! My name is Blythe. I'm 17 and I'm from San Francisco, California. What drew me to the subject of mental health care insurance was seeing how high the poverty and homeless rate was in the Bay Area. In fact, it's the third highest behind the two most populated cities, New York and LA.
The US's currently policy with health insuranse makes it where only employed citizens recieve it rather than their being free covereage which makes homeless people at a disadvantage.</td>
    
    <td> Hi!! I'm Jannelly. I'm 15 and I'm from North Carolina. I wrote the section on healthcare for poc women because for one, I am a poc girl but I also feel like it is not that talked about. Healthcare in America is not that great for the general public to begin with but I decided to get specific and try to help out other people like me. If the other subjects on our website interest you, please check them out! We have plenty of resources listed to help. </td>
