      <figcaption>The 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, Affordable Care Act, and state mental health parity laws require certain health care plans to provide mental and physical health benefits equally. And yet, insurers are still not covering mental health care the way they should. A 2019 report found that a behavioral health office visit is over five times more likely to be out-of-network than a primary care appointment. You can learn more through the links below

    <p>While medicine is a huge industry, many people cannot afford the high expense of receiving healthcare.  This is particularly prevalent in low income communities.  The obstacles that many people face discourage them from taking action in their health and many minor illnesses or health issues go untreated until they become major concerns. Minimizing these challenges will allow individuals struggling financially to take back control of their health and get the medical attention they need before it becomes an emergency. </p>
